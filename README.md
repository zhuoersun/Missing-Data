# Missing-Data
This is a list of R codes necessary for simulations and real data analysis for the paper of "Semiparametric Estimation in Regression with Missing Covariates Using Single-Index Models". 

simulations
----------------

* Please put all .R files under the same directory;

* AWEE_MAR.R, CC_MAR.R, full_MAR.R, ip_aug_MAR.R and ip_noaug_MAR.R are files of different functions 
   for different methods, including generating data, point estimation, SE & coverages calculation;

* Please run "Table_x_n=..." to get the corresponding results in the tables. The functions in the above
   files will be sourced;

* Detailed explanations are given as comments in the .R files.
